                <p>Xavier University of Louisiana’s Core Curriculum (the Core) emphasizes Xavier’s identity as a Catholic and historically Black institution and supports the goal that students should achieve both breadth and depth of knowledge in the liberal arts. The Core enriches the undergraduate educational experience by exposing students to integrative approaches in learning and by cultivating nuanced perspectives for engaging in thought and in action the major questions of their lives. Required of all undergraduate students in the College of Arts and Sciences, the 40 credit hours of the Core provide the foundation and, together with the major program of study, contribute to a well-rounded education.</p>

                    <h2>Foundations</h2>
                    <p>Foundations at Xavier introduces Xavier students to college-level written and spoken rhetoric, quantitative reasoning, and critical thinking and writing skills necessary for success in school and in life. The Experience courses expand both knowledge and skills, and shape the habits of mind that lie at the heart of what it means to live Xavier’s mission. In addition to promoting general academic skills, these courses help students explore issues of self-identity and foster an examination of their individual roles within larger communities. These Experience courses also offer opportunities to create new communities among students and to develop unique mentoring relationships with professors. </p>

                    <h2>Explorations</h2>
                    <p>Explorations courses build on the Foundational requirements and foster the breadth of knowledge, skills, and values essential to a well-rounded, liberal arts education within the intellectual space of a Catholic and historically Black university. These categories are not organized by department or discipline, but by areas of inquiry. It is expected that these areas may inspire the creation of new courses – or revisions to existing ones – that will expand the interconnectivity of different perspectives and blur the lines of disciplinary isolation. The courses in any particular category might come from several disciplines. If an individual course is approved for multiple Explorations categories, students may only count that course to fulfill one of the categories.&nbsp;</p>

                    <h2>Engagements</h2>
                    <p>Creation is the result of the highest form of thinking, and an exploration of the liberal arts requires a consideration of how humans create: how they express themselves by appealing to the emotions and senses of others. Aesthetic, performative, and literary expression enable us to engage with one another creatively and artistically and reveal how artistic practices are both a reflection of and act as an agent on the world around us. By exploring how different forms of expression have developed, or by learning how to communicate in a creatively expressive way, students will embrace a critical component of liberal education.</p>
